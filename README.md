# Garry's Mod SWEPs
This repository includes the source code of my addons for [Customizable Weaponry 2.0](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=349050451) and [TFA Base](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=415143062).

**Note:** I'm currently porting *some* of my CW 2.0 guns over to the TFA base, but that does not mean that I'll be working on them 24/7 as I don't have that much time or dedication anymore. Updates will be released occasionally, but I can't promise anything. Oh, and the majority of my CW 2.0 weapons are from 2015-2017, which means that the source code is a mess. I've improved a lot since then but I'm still no Lua expert.

## Installing
Paste the folders inside of `PathToYourSteamFolder/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons`. Make sure you have the required workshop addons installed for the weapons or they won't work.
