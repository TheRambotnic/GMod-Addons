- Recompile the model and make changes as necessary
- Make sure the idle position snaps back properly after reloading and deploying the weapon
	- If it DOESN'T: make realignments to the sights' positions
	- If it DOES: leave everything as it is

- Ask XvxM4thersxvX for the previous weapon stats before making balancing updates
- Most importantly: ACTUALLY update the god damn weapon after it's been on hold for 2 fucking years
