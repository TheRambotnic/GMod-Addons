[list]
[*] Added support for the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=713125469]CW 2.0 - Cases[/url] mod (To spawn the weapon case, go to the "Entities" tab and then click on the "Rambotnic's Cases" category)
[*] Added my Steam Profile link on the SWEP.Contact line (Not important at all...)
[*] Added new sounds for the Long Barrel attachment (Thanks to NightmareMutant)
[*] Added PMAG Gen M3 (it has a 36-round capacity)
[*] Added Assault Stock
[*] Added a custom 5.56x45MM Green Tip caliber entity. Now, when using Green Tip rounds, it will display "5.56x45MM Green Tip" on the Heads-Up Display (You MUST pick up ammo after selecting it!)
[*] Added Tan and Green textures for the Assault Stock attachment (Thanks to Niggarto el Negro)
[*] Added Marpshyr (Sci-Fi) textures for the Quad-Stack Magazine, PMAG Gen M3, Assault Stock and EXT RIS Receiver attachments (Thanks to Niggarto el Negro)
[*] Added world models for every attachment
[*] Added an IndividualThink() function, that decreases the movement scale when walking while aiming
[*] Added an util.PrecacheModel function that makes the weapon load faster when spawning it for the first time (May take longer to load the game)
[*] Added attachment dependency for DBAL-A2 Laser (Now it can only be used when the Sci-Fi skin is active)
[i](The reason why I did this, is because shotgundiplomat1993 didn't like the idea of the Sci-Fi Suppressor being the only attachment that can be unlocked with the Sci-Fi skin. I wanted to make the Holographic Sight to be restricted, but Niggarto didn't like the idea, so I did that to the DBAL laser, since it looks very Sci-Fi-ish)[/i]
